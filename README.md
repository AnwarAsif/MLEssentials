Machine Learning Essentials

# Terminologies 
1. Pipelines: A sequence of data processing components is called data pipeline. 

# ML Algorithms 
## 1. Regressions 
- Linear Regression 
- Tree Regression 
- Forest Regression 

## 9. Unsupervised Learning Techniques 
- **Use case:** Unsupervised Learning is useful for Clustering, Anomaly dettecton and Density estimation
  - Clustering: group similar instances together into clusters    
    - Data Analysis
    - Customer Segmentation 
    - Recommender system
    - search engines 
    - image classification
    - semi-supervised learning 
    - dimensionality reduction 
  - Anomaly Detection: what normal data looks like then use that to detect abnormal instances.
    - new trend in time serise
    - find defective items
  - Desnsity Estimation: Estimating the probability density function PDF of the random process
    - anomaly detecttion: instances located in the very low-density regions liekly to be anamalies 
    - analysis and visualization
